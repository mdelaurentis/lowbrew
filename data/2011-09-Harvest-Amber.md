Harvest Amber
=============

Brewed with homegrown Cascade hops.

Grains
------

14 lbs American 2-Row Pale
1 lb Crystal 60
1 lb Victory

Hops
----

2 oz Homegrown Cascade, 90 mins
1 oz Homegrown Cascade, 60 mins
1 oz Homegrown Cascade, 15 mins
1 oz Homegrown Cascade, 5 mins
2 oz Homegrown Cascade, dry-hopped 4 weeks in secondary

Boil
----

I boiled this one for 90 minutes in an attempt to get some better hop
utilization. I think I boiled 7.5 gallons down to 6 (rather than my
usual 5.5) because I expected to lose some volume during dry-hopping.

90 minute boil
Pre-boil: 7.5 gal (I think), 1.055 sg
Post-boil: 6 gal (I think), 1.066 sg

Notes
-----

This one tastes pretty good, although it's not nearly as hoppy as I
was hoping for. I guess the homegrown hops weren't very strong. I was
expecting them to be around 6% AA, but who knows what they really
are. Nice mouthfeel. There's a little bit of the caramel/banana off
flavor that showed up in the Belgian strong ale, but it's not nearly
as dominant here. This is not exactly what I was going for, but still
very enjoyable.
