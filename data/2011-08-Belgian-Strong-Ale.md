Belgian Strong Ale
==================

Grains
------

16 lbs Belgian 2-Row Pale
1 lb Biscuit malt
1 lb Special B malt
1 lb Belgian Candi Sugar, 45 (not mashed)
1 lb Belgian Candi Sugar 90 (not mashed)

Hops
----

2 oz Styrian Goldings, 90 mins

Boil
----

90 minute boil
Pre-boil: 7 gal, 1.060 sg
Post-boil: 5.5 gal, 1.084 sg

Fermentation
------------

Wyeast Trappist High Gravity yeast, I think. Fermented at a pretty
high temperature; maybe 75 &deg; or higher. Left in primary for a few
weeks and then secondary for maybe a month more.

Notes
-----

This one has some undesireable off flavors. Not sure how to describe
it. Maybe caramel, banana. Pretty sweet, not much hop bitterness and
really no hop flavor or aroma at all. It seemed to get a bit worse
with a couple months of aging too. I suspect the off flavors may be
due to fermenting at higher temperatures. Also, this is the first
batch where I didn't use filtered water; I just let the water sit in
buckets overnight to let the chlorine evaporate.
